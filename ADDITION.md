ADDITION
=========

Estimation:
* I think this will take me 30-60 minutes.
* I think I will need to change 4 files to get this to work. I need to add the command to the interpreter and to the controller, add the command itself, and then add functionality in the model for it.

Review:
* It took me an hour and a half to add this command because there was a temporary bug fix I was unaware of in a teammate's code.
* I needed to update 5 classes to do this. The 4 for the reason I listed above and the fifth for the bug fix.
* I did not get it right on my first try.

Analysis:
* I didn't think it was good to begin with and now I realize it was worse than I thought.
* We should have used reflections for commands and should have had a permanent bug fix for the issue.
* It would taken me hours more to do if I had never seen the code before.
